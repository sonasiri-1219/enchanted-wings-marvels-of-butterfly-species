ğŸ“Š Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains labeled images of various butterfly species, used for classification tasks.

ğŸ§¾ Structure:
train/: Contains training images for multiple butterfly species.
test/: Contains testing images to evaluate model performance.
Training_set.csv: CSV file mapping each image in the training set to its corresponding label.
Testing_set.csv: CSV file for testing set with image filenames and labels.
Each image is a .jpg file, and the labels represent species names.

ğŸ§ª Dataset Usage in the Project
Label encoding was performed using LabelEncoder from scikit-learn.
The image paths were matched to the CSV filenames to load data efficiently.
Images were resized to 224x224 and normalized before training.
Dataset was split into training and validation using train_test_split.
